\n is significantly faster than std::endl in C++.

Here's why:

\n is simply a newline character. It inserts a newline into the output stream without any additional operations.
std::endl does two things:
Inserts a newline character.
Flushes the output buffer.
Flushing the output buffer forces the contents of the buffer to be written to the actual output device (like the console or a file). This operation can be quite expensive, especially if done frequently.

In most cases, you don't need to explicitly flush the output buffer. The buffer is automatically flushed when:

The buffer is full.
The program terminates.
An input operation is performed (e.g., cin).
Therefore, using \n is generally the preferred choice for performance reasons. Only use std::endl if you specifically need to force a flush of the output buffer.

Example:

C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Hello, world!\n"; // Faster
        // std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; // Slower
    }
    return 0;
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, using \n will result in significantly faster execution compared to using std::endl.

Remember: While performance is important, readability and maintainability are also crucial factors. If you need to explicitly flush the output buffer for specific reasons, using std::endl is acceptable. However, in most cases, \n is the better choice.
